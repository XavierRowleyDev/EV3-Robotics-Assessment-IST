Using Micropython, move a Lego EV3 robot across a map while knocking down coke cans in order to collect a duck halfway and take it to the end. The EV3 should be able to follow a black line without human intervention. The line consists of turns, bends and obstacles (in the form of coke cans) and in the middle a duck which the robot must pick up (any means) and take it to the end of the course. You will be marked on speed, accuracy, # of coke cans knocked over, if the duck is collected and successful stopping at the end of the coruse.

NOTES:

-Green code is currently not functional 
-May not work on your EV3 system first try, use Device Browser > Sensors > Colour Sensor > Monintor Values, to determine your own light and colour values for your coruse as small differences can cause the code to not function correctly.
